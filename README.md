# Man-Made Objects Objects (Pun Intended)

## Purpose 
This project neatly demonstrates the use of abstract classes, inner classes, and interfaces. Among Java developers, abstract classed are best utilized for "is-a" type of relationships, while interfaces are best utilized for "has-a" type relationships. For example, A car is a motor vehicle. Therefore, class Car extends (i.e. inherits from) abstract class MotorVehicle. Likewise, a house is a building. Class House extends the abstract class Building. Houses and cars both have windows and are made up of materials, so it is best practice to create an interface that both class House and class Car can use. Inner classes can be used for "in-a" type of relationships. Bedrooms are located in houses. While Bedroom could have been created as a subclass of House, it is more sensible to nest it inside class House. Bedroom does not need to inherit the variables or methods in House.
